# Transform-Represent

## Objectives

### Part 1

* Perform scaling, rotation and translation on various pointclouds.
* Visualize all pointclouds together by constructing a table scene.
* Generate partial pointclouds using multiple different camera views.
* Register pointclouds to a global frame and reconstruct the full scene pointcloud.
* Compute Chamfer's distance between ground truth scene pointcloud and reconstructed pointcloud.

## Part 2

* Understanding of rotation matrices, quarternions and gimbal locks.
* Implementation of codes from one representation to another.
