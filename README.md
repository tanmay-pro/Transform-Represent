# Transform-Represent

## Objectives

### Part 1

* Perform scaling, rotation and translation on various pointclouds.
* Generate partial pointclouds using multiple different camera views.
* Register pointclouds to a global frame and reconstruct the full scene pointcloud.
* Computation of Chamfer's distance between constructed and ground truth pointclouds.

## Part 2

* Understanding of rotation matrices, quarternions and gimbal locks.
* Implementation of codes for conversation from one representation to another.

## Part 3

* Understanding homogeneous coordinates, vanishing points and points at infinity.
* Understanding of frame and point transformations.

## Part 4

* Working in the LiDAR frame and dealing with registration of point clouds.
* Working in the camera frame and the world frame.
