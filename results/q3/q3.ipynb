If we have a vector `<x, y, z>` in a 3 dimensional space, we can represent it as `[x', y', z', w]'` where w represents the added dimension. Now, `x = x'/w, y = y'/w and z = z'/w` are the corresponding relations. Therefore, if we have `w = 1`, we can easily map homogeneous coordinates to our original coordiante system.\n",
